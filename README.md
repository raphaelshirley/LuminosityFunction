# Luminosity Function

Working towards the HELP luminosity function. We are looking at the total dust luminosity as well as possibly a bivariate luminosity function against stellar mass or other physical properties.

The aim is to compare and contrast with the [Gruppioni et al. (2013)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.5209.pdf) luminosity function.
